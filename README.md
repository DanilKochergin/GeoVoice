## 📖 About The Project

**GeoVoice** is an Android application written in Kotlin that allows users to **listen to pre-uploaded audio guides based on location**.

The app displays a list of available audio guides and lets users play them.  
Each guide is associated with GPS coordinates, but audio is **only played**, not recorded.
